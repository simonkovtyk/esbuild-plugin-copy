## üí° Introduction

This esbuild plugin simply copies specified files to the output folder during the build process. It reads a list of file paths or patterns, then moves those files into the output directory after
esbuild finishes bundling.

The plugin ensures that static assets, such as images or configuration files, are included in the final build. It‚Äôs lightweight and works without altering the bundling
process itself. By automating file copying, it reduces manual steps and keeps the build process smooth and consistent.

## üîß Usage

```typescript
fileCopyPlugin(options);
```

This function needs to be called inside the esbuild configuration in order to use this plugin. It will provide the plugin inside the build process of esbuild.
